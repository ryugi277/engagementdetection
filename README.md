# engagementdetection

This repository contains engagement detection models using customized zoom dataset (available by request). Unfortunately, the model sizes used in this repository are quite large, making it impractical to directly upload them to GitHub due to file size limitations. These models require larger storage and resources for access. You can still access and use these models through the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17tVPjGMNK1fOEHfQxHPh9UMcBGq8Z798?usp=sharing
